EagleScope is a comprehensive project that consists of both backend and frontend components, designed to map and optimize drone routes for search and rescue missions. This project includes a web interface for interacting with the system and a backend API for processing route calculations and other related functionalities.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **🛠️ Backend**: Handles the core logic for route optimization, calculations, and API services.
- **💻 Frontend**: Provides a user interface for interacting with the system, allowing users to visualize routes and interact with drone mapping features.
- **📜 Detector**: Contains Python scripts for detecting specific conditions or data processing related to the project.

### 🔧 Backend

The backend is built with Node.js and provides the necessary APIs for the project.

#### 🗂️ Key Components

- **📡 Controllers**: Manage the logic for handling API requests.
- **💼 Services**: Contain the core business logic and computations.
- **🔗 Routes**: Define the API endpoints.
- **🧰 Utils**: Utility functions, such as distance matrix calculations.

#### 🛠️ Installation

1. Navigate to the `Backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. The API will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 🖥️ Frontend

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, providing a modern and responsive user interface.

#### 🗂️ Key Components

- **🏠 App.tsx**: The main entry point of the React application.
- **🔧 Components**: Reusable UI components such as cards, sidebars, and form fields.
- **📊 Mock Data**: Sample data used during development.
- **🖼️ Assets**: Images and icons used in the UI.

#### 📚 Key Libraries

- **🗺️ Leaflet**: Used for integrating interactive maps into the application.
- **📈 Recharts**: Used for creating dynamic and interactive charts.

#### 🛠️ Installation

1. Navigate to the `Frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

# 👁️ Real-Time Person Detection with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Upload to Amazon S3

This project is a real-time person detection system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and the `cvzone` library. When a person is detected, the program captures an image, saves it in JPEG format, and automatically uploads the image to an Amazon S3 bucket. Additionally, a temporary link to the image is generated, which can be used in the front-end.

## 🚀 Features

- **👤 Real-Time Person Detection**: Uses MediaPipe and the `cvzone` library to detect the presence of people in the image captured by the webcam.
- **📸 Image Capture**: When a person is detected, an image is captured and saved locally in JPEG format.
- **☁️ Automatic Upload to Amazon S3**: The captured image is automatically sent to an Amazon S3 bucket.
- **🔗 Generation of Signed URLs**: After the upload, a signed URL is generated for temporary access to the image on S3. This URL can be used to display the image in a web interface.

## 📋 Requirements

Before running the program, make sure you have installed the following dependencies:

- 🐍 Python 3.7 or higher
- 🖼️ OpenCV
- 🧠 MediaPipe
- 🛠️ cvzone
- 🌐 boto3
- 🔑 AWS CLI configured with valid credentials

### 🔧 Installing Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless mediapipe cvzone boto3
```

### 🛠️ AWS CLI Configuration

Before running the program, you need to configure your AWS credentials so that boto3 can access S3. Use the following command to configure AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

Provide your `AWS Access Key ID`, `AWS Secret Access Key`, `default region`, and preferred output format.

## 🚀 Running the Program

1. Clone this repository or copy the code to your local environment.

2. Run the Python script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python Detector.py
   ```

   Make sure you have a connected and working webcam.

### ⚙️ Script Parameters

- **🗂️ bucket_name**: Name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the images will be stored.
- **⏱️ capture_interval**: Minimum interval between image captures in seconds.

### 💡 Usage Example

The script captures images when it detects a person and automatically uploads them to S3. A link to the image is generated and can be used in the front-end to display the captured image.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### 🛑 `NoCredentialsError`

This error indicates that boto3 could not find the AWS credentials. Make sure you have correctly configured AWS CLI with `aws configure` and check if the credentials are in your credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`).

### ❌ `S3UploadFailedError`

If you encounter this error, it might be related to permissions on the S3 bucket or the IAM policy. Check the bucket permissions and the policies attached to your user or role.

### 🚫 `AllAccessDisabled`

This error indicates that access to the object or bucket has been disabled. Check the S3 bucket access settings and IAM permissions.
